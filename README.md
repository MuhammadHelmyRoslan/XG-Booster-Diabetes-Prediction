# XG-Booster-Diabetes-Prediction
This project aims to predict diabetes among patients using a dataset based on various health metrics. We employ the XGBoost classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is titled diabetes_dataset.csv. It includes various health-related features such as gender, age, hypertension status, heart disease presence, smoking history, BMI, Hemoglobin A1c levels, blood glucose levels, and the diabetic status of the individuals.

Features
Gender: Male or Female
Age: Age of the individual
Hypertension: Presence of hypertension
Heart Disease: Presence of any heart disease
Smoking History: Current, former, or non-smoker
BMI: Body Mass Index
HbA1c Levels: Hemoglobin A1c levels
Blood Glucose Levels: Blood glucose levels
Tools and Libraries
The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language with several libraries:

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-Learn for machine learning model building, including preprocessing tools like StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.
XGBoost for the classification model.
Workflow
Data Loading and Inspection: Load the dataset and perform initial inspections to understand its structure and content.
Data Preprocessing:
Recode smoking_history to categorical values.
Convert categorical variables to a suitable format for modeling using one-hot encoding.
Normalize numeric features to prepare them for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualize the relationships between features using a correlation heatmap.
Examine the distribution of categorical features.
Model Building:
Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Train the XGBoost classifier with the processed data.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using metrics such as the confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
Discuss the potential for using additional metrics and cross-validation for robust assessment.
Conclusion
The XGBoost model shows promising results, achieving high accuracy in predicting diabetes status. Further enhancements could include more comprehensive metric evaluation, cross-validation for model assessment, and analysis of feature importance to understand the influence of various health indicators.
